# **GHOST STARTER â€” I'm a very minimal starter theme for Ghost. Use me to get started on an awesome theme.**

====================================================

This starter theme is intended as a boilerplate for developers working on custom Ghost themes. 
It's still a work in progress. Feel free to contribute and open issues if you have any suggestions.

Inspired by [Underscores.me](http://underscores.me/)
  

## Features

-  **Infinite Scrolling**.A simple JS plugin, Activated by default. Can be removed from the defaults.hbs file.

-  **No CSS**. No default css to get in your way. 

-  **No Frameworks**. Unlike many other boilerplate templates on Github, this doesn't include any libraries. Add your favourite CSS & JS libraries yourself.
 

## Get started

**Download / clone theme into the theme folder of your development.**
